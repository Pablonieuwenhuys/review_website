Good Italian pizzas napolitanas. Friendly service. Delicious desserts and good cocktails. Nice terrace and ambience. Pleasant temperature indoors during summer weather. Do not forget to ask for the olive oil or spicy olive oil to add on top of the pizza, it gives a nice final touch and enhances that very nice flavors. Definitely coming back to try other pizzas and desserts.
